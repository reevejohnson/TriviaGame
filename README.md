# TriviaGame

This game uses JQuery to create a timed quiz. The quiz resides in an object and when the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the script will pull all questions from the object to create a multiple choice quiz. I used "radios" for answer choice selection, which are prepended to the answer choices when the quiz is created.

The timer starts at 75 seconds and counts down to 0, after which the quiz is over and the score is posted. I used timers and decrement of intervals to achieve this.
