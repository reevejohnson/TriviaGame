# TriviaGame

This game uses JQuery to create a timed quiz. The quiz resides in an object and when the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the script will pull all questions from the object to create a multiple choice quiz. The timer starts at 75 seconds and counts down to 0, after which the quiz is over and the score is posted.
